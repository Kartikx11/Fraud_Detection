Steps to run the code:
1> Run the Code for EDA, Preprocessing, and Model Building:

This part performs EDA, preprocesses the dataset, builds and evaluates multiple models, and selects the best one (XGBoost in this case).

2> Save and Deploy the Model as an API:

The model is saved using pickle and deployed using a Flask API.
To deploy the model as an API, ensure Flask is installed (pip install flask).
Run the API with python app.py.

3> Make API Requests:

You can make POST requests to http://localhost:5000/predict by passing a single transaction as JSON for fraud prediction.
