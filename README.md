# Fraud_Detection
In this project, I detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. I perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, and apply models like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best model is optimized and deployed on an API for real-time fraud detection.
